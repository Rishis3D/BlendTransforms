# BlendTransforms
BlendTransforms plug-in for Maya

#Introduction

At the moment there are only builds (and build scripts) for Windows.

#Installation

At the moment there are builds for Maya 2013 and 2015 in the Install folder. From the relevant version directory copy 

> \install\\\<Your Version\>\plug-ins\BlendTransforms.mll

to one of your Maya plug-ins folders. Usually something like this

> C:\Users\\\<User\>\Documents\maya\\\<Maya Version\>\plug-ins

> C:\Program Files\Autodesk\\\<Maya Version\>\bin\plug-ins

Then copy the scripts from

> \install\\\<Your Version\>\scripts\

to one of your Maya scripts folders. Usually something like this

> C:\Users\\\<User\>\Documents\maya\\\<Maya Version\>\scripts

> C:\Users\\\<User\>\Documents\maya\scripts

Lastly, copy the icons and shelves in to your Maya prefs directory. This is normally something like

> C:\Users\\\<User\>\Documents\maya\\\<Maya Version\>\prefs

If everything worked correctly when you re-boot Maya you should see a shelf named __BlendTransforms__. Hit the __SRC__ button and as long as you get no errors everything has worked.
